<h2>Git Explained for Beginners: How Developers Collaborate Without Breaking Things</h2>

<p>
     As developers, we don't just write code we constantly change it. Features evolve, bugs appear, and multiple people often work on the same files at the same time. Git solves the chaos that comes with that reality.
</p>
<ul>This article breaks down:

<li>What Git is</li>

<li>How it's used in real team environments</li>

<li>Why it matters professionally</li>

<li>And why Git and GitHub are not the same thing</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're a beginner, this guide is for you.</p>

<h3>What Is Git?</h3>
Git is a version control system.
<ul>In simple terms, Git helps you:
<li>Track changes to your code over time</li>
<li>Save snapshots of your project (called commits)</li>
<li>Revert to earlier versions if something breaks</li>
<li>Work on features safely without impacting others</li>
<li>Git runs locally on your computer and works even without an internet connection.</li>
<li>Think of Git as a time machine for your code one that lets you explore ideas without fear of losing progress.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Git isn't just a “nice to have” tool. It's foundational.</h4>

<ul>Without Git:
<li>You can't safely experiment</li>
<li>You risk losing working code</li>
<li>Team collaboration becomes error-prone</li>
<li>Debugging becomes guesswork</li>
</ul>

<ul>With Git:
<li>Every change is documented</li>
<li>Mistakes are reversible</li>
<li>Collaboration is structured</li>
</ul>
