                      <h2>1. One Week Before the Interview: Preparation is Key</h2>
                        <h4>Research the Company:</h4>
                        <p> 
                            Demonstrates your genuine interest in the role and company. Do the research compile your findings and it will show in the interview.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Understand the Job Description:</h4>
                        <p> 
                            Helps tailor your answers to align with what the employer is seeking, and what you are capable of bringing to the team.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Know Your Interviewers:</h4> 
                        <p>
                            Builds rapport and allows you to anticipate their priorities. To do this requires you to research prior to the interview and to do active listening when the interviewer speaks.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Plan Your Outfit:</h4>
                        <p> 
                            Dressing appropriately boosts confidence and shows professionalism. Reseach shows that an individual is more confident when dressed in their best attire. If you have to buy your best attire, try to think of it as an investment in your future self. 
                        </p>
                      <h2>2. Three Days Before the Interview: Polish Your Responses</h2>                     
                        <h4>Practice Common Questions:</h4> 
                        <p>
                            Prepares you to answer confidently and concisely. You can use note cards, or a word doc, whatever you prefer as long as you prepare for the questions and answers. It helps if you have a friend or family member ask you the questions like a mock interview.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Prepare for Role-Specific Questions:</h4> 
                        <p>
                            Shows your expertise and preparedness by knowing the role you applied for. If you are interviewing for a software developer position, be prepared to code and or white board your code out.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Create Your Own Questions:</h4> 
                        <p>
                            Demonstrates interest and engagement. Hiring Mangers love a good question from a future employee. So, when asked <q>Do you have any questions for us?</q> Be ready with your questions, and follow ups.
                        </p>                
                      <h2>3. The Day Before the Interview: Final Touches</h2>                      
                        <h4>Revisit Key Notes:</h4> 
                        <p>
                            Refreshes your memory on critical details. Like the company's mission, values, and the key points from the job description. Reviewing the skills and accomplishments you want to highlight ensures you'll present yourself confidently.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Test Your Tech (for Virtual Interviews):</h4> 
                        <p>
                            Ensures a smooth, professional experience. Check your camera, microphone, and internet connection to ensure everything works perfectly. Practice logging into the video platform and adjusting settings for proper lighting and background. This avoids last minute technical hiccups.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Plan Your Route (for In-Person Interviews):</h4>

                            Avoids delays and stress on the interview day. Research the location, figure out the best route, and account for possible delays. Plan to arrive 15-20 minutes early, giving you time to compose yourself before walking in. A stress-free commute helps set a positive tone.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Prepare Materials:</h4>

                        <h4>Arrive Early:</h4> 
                        <p>
                            Shows punctuality and professionalism. Aim to reach the venue 15 minutes before your scheduled time. For virtual interviews, log in 5-10 minutes early to show you're punctual and prepared. Waiting a little before the meeting starts demonstrates your reliability.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Mind Your Body Language:</h4>

                            Communicates confidence and enthusiasm. Your nonverbal cues communicate volumes. Sit up straight, maintain good eye contact, and avoid crossing your arms or fidgeting. A genuine smile and an attentive posture convey confidence and engagement.

                        <h4>Engage Actively:</h4> 
                        <p>
                            Builds a connection with your interviewer. Be an active participant in the conversation. Listen carefully, respond thoughtfully, and tie your answers back to the role and the company's goals. Asking questions during the discussion demonstrates enthusiasm and curiosity.
                        </p>
                        <h4>End on a Strong Note:</h4>
                        <p>
                            Leaves a positive final impression. Finish the interview with a confident close. Reiterate your interest in the position and thank the interviewer for their time. If possible, inquire about the next steps in the hiring process.
                        </p>                
                      <h2>5. After the Interview: Follow-Up</h2> 
                        <h4>Reflect on Your Performance:</h4>

            <section class="Two">
             <h2>Technical Assessment Preparation</h2>  
                    <h3 class="tech">1. Understand the Format:</h3>
                    <p>Before the assessment, confirm the format (e.g., coding challenge, multiple-choice, or system design). Platforms like HackerRank, LeetCode, or Codility may host the test, so familiarize yourself with them. Knowing what to expect reduces stress.
                    </p>                   
                    <h3 class="tech">2. Review Core Concepts:</h3>
                    <p>Focus on key topics relevant to the role, such as algorithms, data structures, or specific technologies like React, Python, or databases. Tailor your preparation to match the job description and assessment guidelines.
                    </p>                   
                    <h3 class="tech">3. Practice Problem-Solving:</h3>
                    </p>Dedicate time to solving coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode or Codewars. Start with easy problems to build confidence, then progress to medium and hard ones. Set a timer during practice to mimic real-time constraints.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="tech">4. Set Up Your Environment:</h3>
                    <p>If the assessment allows using your own environment, ensure your IDE, tools, and libraries are installed and configured. Practice in this environment to get comfortable with shortcuts and debugging.
                    </p>                    
                    <h3 class="tech">5. Brush Up on Basics:</h3>
                    <p>
                    Don't overlook fundamental skills like clean coding, optimizing for performance, and commenting your code. Demonstrating clarity and thought process often matters more than simply arriving at the correct solution.
                    </p>                    
                    <h3 class="tech">6. Stay Calm During the Test:</h3>
                    <p>
                    Read each question carefully before diving into code. Break down complex problems into smaller steps, and explain your approach if required. If stuck, move to the next question and return later to save time.

                        <p>Prepare to structure your answers using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result). This ensures you provide clear, concise responses that highlight your contributions and outcomes.
                        <p>

                        <h5>Practice Common Questions:</h5>
                        <h3 class="BA">Prepare for frequent behavioral questions, such as:</h3>
                        <q>
                        Tell me about a time you faced a challenging situation.”
                        “Describe a time you failed and how you handled it.”
                        “How do you prioritize tasks under tight deadlines?” Practice responses out loud or with a partner to gain confidence.
                        </q>
                        <h5>Demonstrate Soft Skills:</h5>
                        <p>
                        Focus on traits like communication, adaptability, and problem-solving. Behavioral assessments often measure how you interact with others and handle stress, so remain calm and positive throughout.
                        </p>
