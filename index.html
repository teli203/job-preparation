            <h1>Skills</h1>
                <p>Employers seek candidates who are not only qualified but also continually improving. Enhancing job specific skills through projects or certifications demonstrates initiative and readiness. Being able to showcase practical applications of your skills sets you apart and instills confidence in your capabilities.

            <h1>Research</h1>
                <p>Understanding the company, its culture, and mission is essential to show genuine interest. Researching the role allows you to align your responses and ideas during interviews. This knowledge demonstrates preparation and your ability to contribute meaningfully to the company's goals. Many may disagree but this research allows you to determine if the company is a good fit for you, and if you align well with their business. If you are one who applies to all open jobs just to get hired this may not seem beneficial to you, but trust the process. Doing the reseach may save you from job hoping later on.

            <h1>Interview Preparation</h1>
                <p>Interview preparation is essential for presenting yourself as a confident and capable candidate. By practicing common questions, you become familiar with the format and can anticipate what might be asked. Behavioral questions, often aimed at assessing past actions, can be addressed effectively using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result). This structured approach allows you to clearly demonstrate your problem solving and decision making skills. Preparation also reduces nerves, enabling you to focus on creating a positive impression through thoughtful answers and confident communication.

            <h1>Resume</h1>
                <p>A well crafted resume and cover letter are your first impression to potential employers. Tailoring these documents to the job description showcases your understanding of the role and highlights relevant achievements, making it easier for hiring managers to see your fit. They demonstrate your attention to detail and ability to communicate your value effectively.
