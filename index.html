            <h1>Research</h1>
                <p>Understanding the company, its culture, and mission is essential to show genuine interest. Researching the role allows you to align your responses and ideas during interviews. This knowledge demonstrates preparation and your ability to contribute meaningfully to the company's goals. Many may disagree but this research allows you to determine if the company is a good fit for you, and if you align well with their business. If you are one who applies to all open jobs just to get hired this may not seem beneficial to you, but trust the process. Doing the reseach may save you from job hoping later on.

            <h1>Networking</h1>
                <p>UGH... Incoming... People.. you don't know, and may never physically meet in person. Yes, you may have guessed it from the section title, but Professional Networking, and Presence matters when seeking your dream employement. Believe it or not, but an updated LinkedIn profile and a professional online presence are essential tools in today's job market. They allow employers to verify your qualifications, view your professional accomplishments, and assess your industry connections. Networking with professionals can open doors to mentorship, valuable insights, and job leads, while a polished online image reassures employers of your professionalism and reliability.
                </p>
                <p>For the introverts in the world, the digital nature of LinkedIn and online networking offers a less intimidating way to build connections. Thoughtful engagement, such as commenting on posts or sending personalized messages, can be an effective and comfortable way to expand your network without having to physically meet a person. So don't be afraid to put yourself out there by commenting, liking a post, or dare I say it.. making your own post for others to witness and speak on.

            <h1>Interview Preparation</h1>
                <p>Interview preparation is essential for presenting yourself as a confident and capable candidate. By practicing common questions, you become familiar with the format and can anticipate what might be asked. Behavioral questions, often aimed at assessing past actions, can be addressed effectively using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result). This structured approach allows you to clearly demonstrate your problem solving and decision making skills. Preparation also reduces nerves, enabling you to focus on creating a positive impression through thoughtful answers and confident communication.
